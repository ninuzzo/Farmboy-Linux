# Farmboy-Linux
Farmboy-Linux is a lightweight Linux distribution based on Arch Linux, aimed at both
experts and beginners. Farmboy-Linux can recover your old PC and put it to great use
or make you cut back on hardware.

This installation script will reproduce my exact environment, with all sensible
configuration defaults and it is meant to be run from the Arch Linux installation CD.
