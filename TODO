(see UEFI systems). I don't have Windows and couldn't test

ob-autostart has a bad interface
Develop another solution that parses .config/openbox/autostart

* make sure MINGB is correct

* Develop testing tools, e.g. install mesa-demos and launch
glxinfo | grep "direct rendering"
to check whether the graphics card is accelerated

* Implement folder sharing. Install and test extra/gnome-user-share or use the
method outlined here:
http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Samba#GNOME_Files.2C_Nemo.2C_Caja.2C_Thunar_and_PCManFM
Note there is no "Browse Network" available in PCManFM. That one is easy to fix:
Just edit the file leafpad ~/.config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks
And add the following line to the bottom:
network:/// Browse Network
(it looks like only read-only sharing works this way)

* Develop a GUI to add and delete users and set the no password
logins using gtkdialog.

* obmenu, wait for it to be refined before considering adding it.
